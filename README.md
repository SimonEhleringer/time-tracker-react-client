# time-tracker-react-client

## Introduction

Thank you for sending me this remote assignment. I had a lot of fun working on it.

## Setup

First you should setup the [backend](https://github.com/SimonEhleringer/TimeTrackerApi).

When the backend is running you can setup and use the frontend:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SimonEhleringer/time-tracker-react-client.git
$ cd ./time-tracker-react-client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
