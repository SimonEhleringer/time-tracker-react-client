# time-tracker-react-client

## Introduction

Thank you for sending me this remote assignment. I had a lot of fun working on it.
The task is almost completed. The only thing that is missing is the feature to pause and resume the timer in the given time.
I took a break of 30 minutes.

I'm really satisfied with the backend. In my opinion the code is clean and well structured.

In the frontend there are some improvements that could be done. I'm not satisfied with the time tracker, because I think the code could be cleaner.

## Setup

First you should setup the [backend](https://github.com/SimonEhleringer/TimeTrackerApi).

When the backend is running you can setup and use the frontend:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SimonEhleringer/time-tracker-react-client.git
$ cd ./time-tracker-react-client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
